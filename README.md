#  COVID-19 Global Data Tracker

This project is a comprehensive analysis of global COVID-19 trends using real-world data from [Our World in Data](https://github.com/owid/covid-19-data). It focuses on **cases, deaths, and vaccinations** across countries and time.

> 📊 Built using Python and Jupyter Notebook, the report combines data processing, visualizations, and narrative insights.

## 🎯 Project Objectives

- ✅ Import and clean global COVID-19 data
- ✅ Analyze time-based trends (cases, deaths, vaccinations)
- ✅ Compare statistics across countries (e.g., Kenya, USA, India)
- ✅ Visualize data with clear and readable charts
- ✅ Communicate insights in a well-documented notebook

## 🧰 Tools & Libraries Used

- `pandas` – for data loading, cleaning, and manipulation
- `matplotlib` – for plotting line and bar charts
- `seaborn` – for enhanced visualizations
- `Jupyter Notebook` – for combining code, visuals, and markdown
